It would be great if you have the knowledge and experience to discuss the design or refactoring of common components. If you are curious about “how it works” while learning how to use React, we welcome you with open arms.
• You need basic knowledge (communication-related knowledge such as HTTP, SSL, CORS, etc.) to communicate smoothly with back-end developers and mobile app developers. As the same application is being served through various domains, we often encounter issues that cannot be encountered in a simple service/development environment.
• Competency is not considered proportional to years of experience. However, we believe that the knowledge acquired through experience can be of great help in quickly responding to unexpected situations or finding the cause of difficult issues. Generally speaking, we believe that approximately 5 years of development experience is required to fill this position.
• It is good to enjoy acquiring new knowledge, but avoid being preoccupied with applying skills. New technologies and products are always created in the process of solving existing “problems.” Based on your understanding of this, if you can convince your colleagues that we are experiencing the same problem and can solve it efficiently, we will give you permission to try as much as you want.
