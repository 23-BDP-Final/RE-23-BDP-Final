When I joined, I decided to join because Lemon Base was well-received in the market and saw the experienced engineer leadership team. Now, about a year and a half after joining, the Lemon Base team is growing healthily according to indicators, and its products are continuously improving, creating an environment where industrial technicians can work with peace of mind. • The Lemon Base team is a team that considers industrial technicians as ‘maker colleagues.’ My opinions and questions are accepted as the opinions of the crew working together to create the product, and in the process, I am able to further improve my understanding of the domain and customers. We are growing by thinking about which technologies can be used to provide customers with a smoother experience and exchanging feedback with fellow engineers! [How the Lemon Base Frontend Chapter works] • Research and improve methods to effectively solve problems experienced by various user personas (member leader administrators). • Managers want convenience features that save them management time and dashboards that give them an at-a-glance view of results. To achieve this, Lemonbase front-end engineers take on various technical challenges related to data visualization and operational convenience for administrators. • Leaders also want a UX that is easy to use like members and a dashboard that allows them to view their direct members at a glance like a manager. To this end, Lemonbase front-end engineers have experience improving data visualization and usability features. • Experience building a design system while closely communicating with designers using the Storybook Zeroheight Figma tool. • In addition to engineering groups and chapters, engineers will belong to squads corresponding to their purpose organizations. During the onboarding process, we observe all squad meetings and go through a process of understanding the products each squad is responsible for, the way they work, and the values ​​they consider important. After that, we communicate with the leader and decide which squad to belong to.

(Required) Please tell us what topics you can currently create and what topics you would like to create in the future. (Optional) Portfolio that can confirm data science-related capabilities (Optional) Portfolio that can confirm competency in writing or educational content 【 Asked to a current content producer 】 Q. What is the best part of doing this job? A. I enjoy doing work that has an impact. There is no limit to the reach of online content, right? So, if you create good content, many people can continue to use it. Even when we are sleeping. I think it's great that so many people learn programming and become excellent developers through the education we created. It's also fun to read reviews that come up every day. Q. You went from working in the field to becoming a content producer. How do you think the two roles are different? A. I think I discover things I couldn't see while working in the field. In practical work, the focus is on creating, while content PD focuses on understanding and grasping the principles. In the past, there were a lot of things that were overlooked because we were so busy making things on schedule. When I looked at the content again to teach it to someone, I realized many new things. There are many times when you have to study more than ten things to teach one thing.
