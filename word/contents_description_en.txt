# Development environment

Unity's Offerwall engineering organization is divided into San Francisco, Boston, London, and Seoul, and we are a team based in Seoul. We have approximately 20 product development staff working in Seoul, and you will work as part of a team of 3 to 5 people.

The services our team develops are divided into services used by customers (game/app users) and services used by in-house employees. The backend consists of several microservices and is written in Ruby on Rails, Elixir, etc. Direct data sources are MySQL, Couchbase, MongoDB, and Redis, and services run on AWS. We communicate with other in-house services through API or the above data sources.

The front end mainly uses React / Redux. Depending on the project, TypeScript and JavaScript are used, and most recent projects are written in TypeScript. Some legacy products also use CoffeeScript + Backbone.js.
Each team member has a front-end/back-end specialty, but there are also engineers who do both.

Plans are made on a company-wide basis on an annual and quarterly basis (Q1 to Q4), and team work is carried out in two-week sprints. Use tools such as Jira, Confluence, GitHub, Zoom, Slack, and Figma. Through regular meetings and reviews, we plan the next sprint work and make up for any shortcomings.

We have product managers, product designers, and engineers working together. From the beginning of product planning, you can actively come up with ideas regardless of your job category, and engineers' opinions are naturally reflected. We place importance on providing real value to product users and customers. Close collaboration between various job groups is also an important value pursued by the team.

- Currently, most of the major domains in the existing Angular-based service have been converted to React, and we are aiming for a complete conversion to React from a long-term perspective.
- If you join, you will be assigned to a squad as part of the front-end team and contribute to achieving the OKR of the squad*.
 *A squad is an organization comprised of several job groups such as Product Owner, Product Designer, Server/Frontend/Mobile Engineer, and Data Analyst. It focuses on one domain to achieve the 29CM product team goal, and sometimes collaborates with other squads/organizations to achieve common goals. can also be achieved.


＜Team Culture＞
The front-end team is pursuing CDD based on Storybook, and is working hard to create the most stable service possible by writing separate testing for important logic. Basically, error monitoring is performed through Sentry, and when large-scale traffic is expected, monitoring is performed through Grafana.

Additionally, we enjoy conferences with colleagues to share knowledge, and encourage pair coding or mob coding among colleagues within the cell.

Ultimately, the front-end team seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the squad's OKR achievement and service quality to enable continued growth of the business, and pursues both the growth of the company and the individual growth of development members through balanced team operation. there is.


＜This is how the 29CM front-end team works＞
1. We prioritize customer experience
    - We understand customer needs and work hard to solve problems from the customer’s perspective.
2. Aim for business impact
    - Before becoming a developer, as a member of the company, I first think about ways to contribute more to the company's business with technology. The company's business development is given top priority.
    - Conversion to React is important, but if necessary, you must also be able to work on the existing Angular base.
    - However, we caution against continuously accumulating technical debt by focusing only on business speed. As you accumulate technical debt, your efforts to achieve greater impact will be hindered by debt. Always try to balance technical debt with speed of business accomplishment.
3. New proposals are tried first and reviewed as much as possible.
    - Persuasion and suggestions are made based on facts, pros and cons of technology, data, and PoC, and through this, we determine and attempt what can be resolved.
    - We try to try new suggestions that add value to the team. Rather than worrying and delaying, we pursue a method of trying things quickly and looking back over a certain period of time.
4. Make decisions freely based on mutual trust
    - Each member freely determines the direction of work under a collaborative method that is documented or agreed upon within the team.
    - If there is ambiguity or tacit knowledge in the work, after discussion, all members pursue work in the same direction.
    If you need to organize documents, organize them into documents and share them.
5. Pursue work efficiency
    - When we feel that inefficiency is occurring in team work or collaboration, we aim to actively discuss it and then initiate action for change.

＜Learn, experience, and grow＞

We want to grow without stopping. The Gangnam Unni team has been solving market problems to achieve the goal of ‘making better medical services available to everyone’. Now, we believe that continuous growth of developers and other members of the product development organization is absolutely necessary in order to solve larger and more complex problems than ever before. Therefore, Gangnam Unni team developers strive to grow through experience in the solution process and learning new knowledge as much as solving the problems they face.

＜ Engineering solutions to complex problems in the aesthetic medicine industry ＞

Many of the problems that the Gangnam Unnie team deals with are large and complex. Gangnam Unni Team web front-end developers use a variety of engineering tools to solve business problems in a balanced manner within various stakeholders and interests, such as medical service users, hospitals, doctors, medical law, and personal information protection. Sometimes we focus on solving problems quickly, but we never stop investing in the sustainability of our systems.

＜ Let’s collaborate ＞

No one on the Gangnam Unni team solves problems alone. The Gangnam Unni team pursues a high level of collaboration. We believe that only through extreme collaboration can great teams be created and solve the large and complex problems of the aesthetic medicine industry. Gangnam Unni Team web front-end developers collaborate closely with fellow front-end developers, server developers, designers, and POs to solve problems that are difficult to solve alone.

 Focus on the value of engineering tools

Instead of blindly following popular technical terms, focus on the value of the tools and use them to solve problems. Currently, Gangnam Unni team developers are trying to establish these techniques to secure a more stable engineering experience.

＜Continuous Integration＞

CI is different from simply using CI support tools such as Jenkins and GitHub Actions. We are creating an environment that satisfies the following CI verification tests introduced by Martin Fowler.

- Every developer commits to the `main` branch at least once a day.
- Every commit runs automated builds and tests.
- If the build and test fails, it is fixed within 10 minutes.

By developing in this environment, the value can be delivered to users more often and faster, and developers can code with a sense of stability.

[Test Automation]

Test automation is a necessary condition for Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and DevOps. A process that does not have a high level of automated testing cannot be called this. We are increasing automated test cases, applying test-driven development, and improving systems and processes so that developers have no fear of delivering value because many of their tasks are verified by tools.

[Pair Programming, Mob Programming, Code Review]

Coding is collaboration. All Gangnam Unni team developers have limited authority so that they cannot commit to the `main` branch at their own discretion. All code must be written through pair programming or approved by peer review before it can be added to the `main` branch through a pull request. Sometimes, server, web front-end, and mobile developers that address the same business requirements come together to write code.

[Domain-Driven Design]

Gangnam Unnie’s team and the aesthetic medicine industry are rapidly changing and expanding. A system's ability to adapt to these changes does not come without effort. If the system cannot adapt to the business environment, the service, organization, and vision will be in vain. To secure a flexible architecture, you need to learn and apply various design techniques.

Gangnam Unnie’s team is establishing domain-driven design as a foundational technique for server system expansion. If you are only focused on tactical techniques, you may enjoy a little engineering fun, but the developer's perspective will be narrowed and you will not be able to capture the value of domain-driven design. So, we focus not only on tactical patterns but also on ubiquitous languages ​​and strategic design to efficiently solve domain problems and ensure architectural sustainability.

Hello, I am creating and operating a home scanning service at the Korea Real Estate Data Research Institute.

I wrote this with the hope that I might meet someone who will create fun and memorable services with us in the future.


One day, I happened to see a TV show about charter fraud.
Looking at the reality that most of the victims are from the vulnerable class, the damage to them is bound to be more critical.

I believe that someone must solve this problem.
I thought it would be extremely rewarding if the service I created could help someone.
Looking inside, there seemed to be a lot of fun things to do in terms of development.


Have you heard of proptech?
Proptech is a term that combines real estate and technology and refers to services that apply cutting-edge IT technology to the real estate industry.

The real estate market is an essential area for people's lives and is a market that will not disappear in the future.
It starts as a service to prevent rent fraud, but
I think it is very attractive because it goes beyond simply creating a website and allows you to continuously provide better services to customers by utilizing various data.



Continuing to grow with customer feedback is a very valuable experience that cannot be easily experienced.


What kind of person are you looking for?

- Someone who can immerse themselves in a team that can grow explosively
- A person who places greater value on team performance than individual performance
- A person with intellectual humility
- People who were angry when they saw the rent fraud
- Those who want to solve the problem of information asymmetry in the real estate market through technology


The main business

Currently, we have prepared a variety of services and projects that we would like to provide.
We want to create the following together:


- Upgrade the core analysis system.

• Data pipeline management
    - As products and businesses grow, the amount of data that needs to be collected and purified and the need for various analyzes based on it continue to increase.
    - Continuous management is required, such as maintaining/repairing existing data pipelines as well as adding new pipelines to meet needs.
    - Additionally, as some pipelines are utilized in conjunction with products, operational issues such as monitoring, alarms, and quick actions must be addressed.

• Establishment of modeling/mart to improve data usability
    - At Lemon Base, most members can handle SQL thanks to in-house query training and the passion for growth of each Lemon Base member, but the number of ad-hoc queries that handle the same information according to their own standards and methods is also increasing. It's a trend. To prevent this, I think it's right to build a data mart or data warehouse consisting of abstractions of appropriate resolution, so that cleaned up and checked logic can be reused.
    - New features and products are being added quickly, and data modeling needs are also rapidly increasing, so we are exploring various ways to solve this. We are independently studying Data Mesh, which has recently been in the spotlight, and in the long term, we want to be able to perform modeling, mart, and pipeline management directly in each domain, and we are slowly taking steps toward this end.

• Improved Data Discovery
    - Various tools and their data, such as production RDBMS, Amplitude, and Pipedrive, are accumulated and gathered into a data lake. A variety of data is already being collected, but logs to measure the impact of new features are also created every day, so it is a data exploration system that allows you to know what data is being collected, what it means, and how it is being used. The need is growing.
    - Accordingly, we have introduced and are operating DataHub, a data discovery platform. When accumulating new logs and data along with operating a data discovery platform, we plan to establish a system to record and manage the necessary information.

- The data part belongs to the development team and collaborates with the backend and front parts.
- The data part is responsible for the overall supply/demand/conversion/loading of patent data.
- I am working on automating and upgrading data-related work.
- Based on a deep understanding of data, I perform a variety of tasks related to it.
- We are discussing through code reviews for better development.

[Work to be done together]

- We are supplying and receiving various types of data and creating a pipeline for the process.
- I am working on ETL work on various data related to patent data.
- Handles the task of purifying and creating data to be entered into the search server.
- We manage the infrastructure that will contain the data and files being created.• Perform data analysis projects
• Design and build data analysis system
• Data collection, preprocessing, analysis, visualization, automation, etc.The KCD Data Platform team largely performs the following roles.

• Data security: Effectively and reliably secures data that helps solve service users’ problems. Because stable service must be possible even as the number of users increases, we are focusing on developing a scalable distributed system and developing/operating a framework that can secure data by automation with minimal resources even when necessary data sources are added.

• Data management/processing: Process/refine the obtained data and apply business logic to create data in the form required for the service. In order to make it easy for anyone to follow the entire data pipeline, we prefer data processing using Spark SQL rather than coding, and consider it important to develop each logic in a form that can be easily tested at any runtime.

• Data API provision: Refined data is provided to the service in API form. We believe it is important to abstract the data existing in the KCD data lake into a generalized form (Property Graph Model) and provide an API to avoid redundant development of complex business logic when developing functions in the service. Rather than simply providing an API, we also consider it important to provide an A/B testing environment that can test various business logic.

It is not an organization that simply performs the work required for services, but also participates in creating new services (e.g. marketplace for business owners, marketing solutions, etc.) by utilizing the platform created while performing the above roles.
